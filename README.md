## 👋 Hi, I'm **Barabu Oscar Edem**

### 🚀 Full-Stack, Mobile & Machine Learning Developer  

I build performant, scalable, and intelligent systems — combining strong backend engineering with refined frontend experiences.  
I specialize in **React Native**, **TypeScript**, **Flutter (Dart)**, and backend development in **Rust** and **Python**, often integrating **machine learning** for intelligent automation.  

I architect systems that balance clean code, maintainability, and performance.

### 💼 What I’m Working On  
🔭 Building **[Qh](#)** — a cross-platform app powered by React Native, TypeScript, and Rust-based APIs.  
👯 Open to collaborating on **open-source tools** around mobile development, backend performance, or ML-driven apps.  
🤝 Looking for contributors interested in **Rust + Python ML pipelines**.
