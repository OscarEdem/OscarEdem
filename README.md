# 👋 Hi — I'm **Barabu Oscar Edem**

### Full-Stack · Mobile · Machine Learning — Systems & Architecture Engineer

I design and build performant, maintainable systems that span **mobile clients**, **high-throughput backends**, and **ML-driven features**. I focus on pragmatic architecture, measurable outcomes, and production-grade engineering: clean abstractions, robust observability, and automated delivery.

## TL;DR
- Senior engineer building cross-platform applications and production ML pipelines.  
- Stack highlights: **React Native + TypeScript**, **Flutter (Dart)**, **Rust (Actix/Axum)**, **Python (FastAPI)**, **ML model production**.  
- Architecture focus: modular monolith → microservices, event-driven components, type-safe API contracts, CI/CD, and observability.

---

## Current Work
- 🔭 **Qh** — Cross-platform app (React Native + Rust APIs + ML personalization).  
- 👯 Open to collaborate on high-performance mobile systems, Rust backend tooling, and ML infra.  
- 🤝 Seeking collaborators for productionizing ML pipelines and cross-platform performance engineering.

## Featured Projects
> *(Replace placeholders with links & short outcomes — recruiters read metrics.)*

1. **Qh — Cross-platform classifieds**  
   - React Native (TypeScript) client, Rust backend services, FastAPI for model endpoints.  
   - Key outcome: improved list-render throughput and reduced cold-start latency by X% (replace with metric).

2. **Realtime Messaging & Notification Service**  
   - Event-driven architecture using Redis + message broker; critical-path services implemented in Rust for low latency.  
   - Key outcome: sustained 2k RPS with P95 latency < 150ms under load test.

3. **ML Recommendation Pipeline**  
   - Data ingestion → feature store → model training (PyTorch) → FastAPI model server with autoscaling.  
   - Key outcome: +Y% uplift in conversion for personalized feed (replace Y with your metric).

## Architecture Snapshot
A standard blueprint I use for mobile → cloud systems:
[Mobile (RN/Flutter)] ↔ [API Gateway / BFF] ↔ [Domain Services (Rust/Python)]
↘
[Event Bus / Stream Processing]
↘
[Model Serving (FastAPI / gRPC)] → [Edge Inference]

Principles:
- **Single responsibility** per service; prefer small, well-instrumented components.  
- **Type-safe contracts** (OpenAPI + shared TypeScript types) for cross-platform consistency.  
- **Observability first**: structured logs, distributed traces, metrics, automated alerts.  
- **Iterate architecture**: start modular monolith, split to microservices when necessary.

---

## Core Focus Areas
- **Mobile architecture**: offline-first sync, list virtualization, fine-grained performance tracing.  
- **Backend systems**: async Rust services for throughput-critical paths; Python for model orchestration.  
- **ML production**: reproducible training pipelines, model versioning, low-latency endpoints.  
- **Dev Experience**: developer tooling, contract testing, IaC, and CI/CD.

## Tech & Tools (condensed)
**Frontend / Mobile:** React Native, Flutter, TypeScript, Expo  
**Backend:** Rust (Actix/Axum), Python (FastAPI, Flask), PostgreSQL, Redis  
**ML / Data:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
**Infra / DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions, Terraform/AWS, Prometheus/Grafana, Sentry

---

## How I Work (process)
1. **Problem framing** — stakeholder goals, success metrics, constraints.  
2. **Design** — API contract, data model, cost/latency tradeoffs.  
3. **Prototype** — thin vertical slice (client → API → DB or model).  
4. **Productionize** — tests, CI/CD, observability, performance tuning.  
5. **Iterate** — metrics-led improvements and cost/scale adjustments.

### Final note
This README balances recruiter readability with technical depth. Replace placeholders (project links, metrics, blog posts) with your real values and we’ll push it to a final polish — icons, color tweaks, or a simplified “one-page” resume form if you prefer.

Would you like me to:
- convert this into a one-column visual README with icons and subtle color accents?  
- or generate a LinkedIn About version from the same content?

(If yes, I’ll output the chosen variant ready to paste.)
